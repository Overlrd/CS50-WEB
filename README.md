# HARVARD-CS50-WEB
CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

# Welcome

This repo contains my project from [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course.

## Project 0
This project consist into building a clone for google search respecting a bunch of [specifications](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/#specification) . 

Your website must meet the following requirements:

 - Your website should have at least three pages: one for regular Google Search (which must be called index.html), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

 - On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.
 - On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
 
- The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.

- ....

The final result looks like :
