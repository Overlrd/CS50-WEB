to do 

## If the user is signed in and is the one who created the listing, the user should have the ability to “close” the auction from this page, which makes the highest bidder the winner of the auction and makes the listing no longer active.

## If a user is signed in on a closed listing page, and the user has won that auction, the page should say so.

## i think in should add a status filed to the auction model , a boolean for if the auction is opened or not
